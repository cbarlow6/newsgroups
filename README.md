# newsgroups

 The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly 
 across 20 different newsgroups. http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/

As a graduate research assistant, I used the 20news-bydate-test dataset to transform and clean text documents for text mining project. [Developing insights from social media using semantic lexical chains to mine short text structures](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016792361930171X)
* Read all 7532 texts documents from 20 topic folders into one dataframe using R. 
* Remove new lines, tabs, & carriage returns 
* Transform to necessary format (topic, post_no, text) 
* Write dataframe to csv
