# newsgroups

 The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly 
 across 20 different newsgroups. http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/

I used the 20news-bydate-test dataset to transform and clean the text documents using R.
* 7532 documents from 20 topic folders were combined and exported into one csv file .
* Read text files, removed new line, tab, & carriage returns, and transformed to necessary format (topic, post_no, text)
